# Matrices

A modular C program for performing basic matrix operations through a command-line interface. Designed for learning and experimenting with structured programming in C.

## Build Instructions

To compile the program, make sure you have `gcc` installed. Then run:

`make`

This will:
- Compile all `.c` source files in `src/`
- Place intermediate `.o` object files in `obj/`
- Output the executable in `bin/` as `main`

To clean up all compiled files:

`make clean`

## Usage

After building, run the program:

`./bin/main`

Follow the prompts in the terminal to perform operations such as:
- Creating matrices
- Displaying matrix contents
- Swapping rows
- Performing other matrix manipulations

## Features

- Modular architecture (`matrix.c` and `menu.c`)
- Dynamic memory management for matrix data
- Input validation for safe user interaction
- Clear terminal-based UI

## Dependencies

- C11-compliant compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library only (no external libraries required)

## Learning Goals

This project was built to practice:
- Modular programming in C
- Makefile automation
- CLI development
- Pointer management and memory allocation

## TODO

- Implement matrix transposition
- Add matrix determinant calculation
- Improve formatting of matrix display output
- Add unit tests
